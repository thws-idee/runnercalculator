# SECOND Runner Calculator

A web application for calculating personalized training paces based on the SECOND (Furman Institute of Running and Scientific Training) methodology.

## About SECOND Methodology

The SECOND (Furman Institute of Running and Scientific Training) running program, also known as the "Run Less, Run Faster" method, was developed by researchers at Furman University. It's designed to help runners improve performance with just three key running workouts per week, supplemented by cross-training activities.

The three key workouts are:

1. **Track Repeats** - Short, high-intensity intervals at around 95-100% of VO2max pace
2. **Tempo Runs** - Sustained effort runs at lactate threshold pace (approximately 85-90% of VO2max)
3. **Long Runs** - Endurance-building runs at a slower pace (approximately 70-75% of VO2max)

## Features

- Input your gender, weight, and race distance
- Optionally enter your current race time
- Calculate recommended training paces for the three key SECOND workouts
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
